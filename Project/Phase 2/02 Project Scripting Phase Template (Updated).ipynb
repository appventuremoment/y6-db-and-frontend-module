    "### Overview\n",
    "Admin work is usually messy, and needing to handle the details of hundreds of projects can cause many issues for teachers, which can results in changes made being lost in the process or not reflected in the most recently sent email. This project provide teachers with a dedicated application to manage the admin mattters of ARP Projects, as well as provides a platform for students to check whether their ARP Project has been listed as ready to present or not with live updates, which removes the need for teachers to send emails revising the excel file of projects that are required to present at research congress.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "This project aims to be a (theoretical) streamlined application for all ARP Project admin matters, which makes it faster and easier to manage the data. Being an RDBMS, it would also allow students to see the most recent status of their projects (whether they are ready to present).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Users\n",
    "Teachers overseeing the ARP admin matters and students\n",
    "\n",
    "### Justification for using RDBMS\n",
    "It is neater than simply dumping the information onto an excel sheet and sending it to students every time it is revised. (It is consistent). If two teachers were to make changes to the same project at once, the changes made will be resolved correctly rather than the final state from one device potentially overwriting changes made from the other device (Transactions are isolated)."
